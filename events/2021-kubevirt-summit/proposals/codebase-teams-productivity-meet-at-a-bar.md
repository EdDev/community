# Title

Codebase, teams and productivity meet at a bar

# Abstract

The relationship between a project codebase structure, the specialization
of its contributors and the architecture has an impact on its health.

Analyzing the impact of this relationship may give us a perspective to
what can be improved to increase productivity.

We will identify the bottle necks and proceed to explore possible options to
resolve them.
